# adaptive-smart-home
This project explores how intelligent adaptive systems can be designed to optimize environmental conditions in a smart home. It combines data-driven insights and machine learning models to predict occupant satisfaction based on real-time environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels.
